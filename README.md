This repository is a complete package for the experiment of Membership Inference VIA Backdooring In Image-Based Malware Classification for the research of Master of IT at Macquarie University 2023.

# Following are instructions of specific files and their uses:

1. In this experiment we have used dike dataset with binary files classified with Malware and Benign.
2. BinaryToGrayConverter-Simple.ipynb program can convert any binary files of a directory to Grey Scale Images by providing the binary folder path as input.
3. BackdoorImageGenerator with Black and white box.ipynb program can generate backdoor images in four different corners and trigger pattern can be white or black.
4. Train Backdoor Densenet.ipynb program trains Densenet ML model with clean samples or backdoor trigger samples.
5. Train Backdoor Mobilenet.ipynb program trains Mobilenet ML model with clean samples or backdoor trigger samples.
6. Train Backdoor VGG-16.ipynb program trains VGG-16 ML model with clean samples or backdoor trigger samples.
7. Train Backdoor VGG-19.ipynb program trains VGG-19 ML model with clean samples or backdoor trigger samples.
8. Train Backdoor NasNetMobile.ipynb program trains NasNetMobile ML model with clean samples or backdoor trigger samples.
9. 30 Clean Test Sample images folder was used for testing clean and backdoored models.
10. Malware Images to add backdoor folder has the images which were backdoored and used in the training setup.
11. Testing_model_with_sample_images.ipynb program was used to test sample images for prediction.

# This reposetory is open to use for any research.
